          As automation technologies continue to advance, their impact on
          employment and various industries becomes increasingly significant.
          This research project examines how automation is reshaping the

        <h2>Economic Impact of Automation</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Automation is transforming employment patterns and economic dynamics
          across various sectors, particularly in the automotive industry. Our
          research reveals both challenges and opportunities as workforces adapt
          to technological change.

          <h3>Job Displacement Statistics</h3>
          <p>
            Between 1990 and 2007, the increase in robots (about one per
            thousand workers) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio
            in a zone by 0.39 percentage points, and average wages by 0.77%.
            Adding one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by six
            workers in that area.

          <h3>New Job Creation</h3>
          <p>
            While robots have displaced unskilled workers on assembly lines,
            they have also created new jobs for machinists, advanced welders,
            and other technicians who maintain the machines or use them to
            perform new tasks. This transformation requires a shift in workforce
            skills and education.

          <h3>Global Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            In South Africa's apparel industry, "We find that the impact of
            automation on unemployment is negligible. In some instances,
            automation has and is predicted to increase employment by improving
            productivity." Automation doesn't always have a negative effect on
            industries and can in fact boost economic activity in certain
            contexts.

        <h2>Security and Privacy Concerns</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          As automotive manufacturing becomes increasingly automated and
          vehicles more connected, new security and privacy challenges emerge
          that must be addressed.

          <h3>Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities</h3>
          <p>
            Automated assembly lines and robotic systems in manufacturing
            facilities can be vulnerable to cyberattacks that could halt
            production or compromise safety. For example, recently CrowdStrike
            pushed a bad software update that almost shut down the entire
            airline industry. Similar vulnerabilities exist in automotive
            manufacturing systems.

          <p>
            Connected and automated vehicles can be targets for hacking,
            potentially allowing unauthorized access to vehicle systems
            including steering, braking, and acceleration. This presents
            significant safety risks as vehicles become more connected and
            autonomous, requiring robust security protocols.

          <p>
            Modern vehicles collect vast amounts of data about driving habits,
            location history, and even biometric information, raising concerns
            about who owns this data and how it's being used. Insurance
            companies may buy this data and use it for various means including
            risk assessment and pricing, potentially without clear consent from
            vehicle owners.

        <p class="section-intro">
          The automation of transportation and manufacturing raises important
          ethical questions that society must address as these technologies
          become more prevalent.

          <h3>Data Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            Relating to modern vehicles collecting data, ethical questions arise
            about who rightfully owns this data and how it is used. Does the
            owner of the car own the data? Or does the manufacturer/seller of
            the car? This question has implications for privacy, consumer
            rights, and business practices.

          <p>
            In the aspect of automated cars, ethical concerns come up with what
            they should do in the event of an accident. The trolley problem is a
            famous example of this ethical dilemma, where a self-driving car
            might have to choose between different harmful outcomes, raising
            questions about how to program machines to make moral decisions.

            In the event of an accident involving an autonomous vehicle, who
            would be held responsible? Is it the programmer, manufacturer, or
            the vehicle owner? One could say that it was the human's fault to
            get into that situation to begin with, but another could say that
            the autonomous system should have been programmed better. This
            creates complex legal and ethical questions that our current systems
            are not fully prepared to address.

        <h2>Case Study: Tesla</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Tesla represents one of the most prominent examples of automation
          implementation in the automotive industry, both in manufacturing and
          self-driving technology.
        </p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Factory Automation</h3>
          <p>
            Tesla's approach to manufacturing automation has evolved
            significantly since the company's early days. Initially, CEO Elon
            Musk pursued an aggressive "lights-out factory" strategy with the
            Model 3 production, attempting to create a fully automated assembly
            line. This strategy faced significant challenges, leading Musk to
            later acknowledge in a tweet on April 13th, 2018 that "Yes,
            excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my
            mistake. Humans are underrated."
          </p>
          <p>
            The company subsequently rebalanced its approach, finding an optimal
            mix of human workers and robotic systems. This case demonstrates
            important lessons about the limitations of automation and the
            continued importance of human workers even in highly automated
            environments. Tesla's experience highlights the risks of
            implementing too much automation too quickly without adequate
            testing and integration planning.

        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Full self driving</h3>
          <p>
            Tesla's approach to autonomous driving technology differs
            significantly from competitors. Rather than using lidar technology,
            Tesla relies primarily on cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors
            combined with machine learning algorithms that improve through data
            collected from its fleet of vehicles. The company has progressively
            released increasingly capable versions of its autopilot and full
            self driving software through over the air updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although these systems have been improving at a rapid rate, there
            have been many concerns over the saftey of camera versus lidar.
            Camera's can only recognize and react to data that they are trained
            on, while lidar can uses lasers and can determine the actual
            distance, no matter the condition. A recent video by YouTuber Mark
            Rober demonstrates the inherent advantages of using lidar by putting
            it through more hypotetical scenarios, and a report by the Wall
            Street Journal investigated the real world implications and impacts
            of tesla's choice of a camera based system.
